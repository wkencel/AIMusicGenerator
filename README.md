# AI Music Generator

AI Music Generator is an open-source online resource that helps individuals create AI music out of midi files. It is a simple, fun tool that I was inspired to make, please let me know if it needs any adjustments.

**Feel free to see what else I'm up to [here](http://willkencelhome2023.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)!**

## What is AI Music Generator?
As a musician and an engineer, I have an interest in analyzing generative AI as a tool to create music. This project is a simple function that takes in midi files and uses AI to produce a new midi file based on those input midi files.

## My SWE pillars

### Conventions make the difference
Learn to write clean code, use conventions and version control to catch mistakes easily, make your work future-proof, and allow others to quickly review it.

### Automate your project
Learn to automate your research workflow. Don't waste time manually running every step. Let your computer take care of it for you, while you can work on something else and don't just wait behind a screen.

### Scale it up if you need more power
When the going gets tough, the tough get cloud computing. Learn to quickly resume your work running instances on remote servers.

## What does this simple python repo offer?
Many of us face the same dilemma. We know that a small investment will have big returns, but we put off making it because we lack the time to make it now. Things like this example in generative AI/music helps us look at generative AI at a granular level and provide a stable foundation to start learning by providing:

- Example code
- Explanation comments
- Starter code
